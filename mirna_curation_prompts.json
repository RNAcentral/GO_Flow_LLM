Evidence Quality:\n- Distinguish between computational predictions and experimental validation\n- Look for direct binding evidence vs indirect regulatory effects\n- Consider experimental controls and proper methodology\n- Be cautious of high-throughput methods without targeted validation\n\n2. Biological Context:\n- Consider whether interactions occur in native cellular contexts\n- Evaluate if effects are direct or could be indirect\n- Assess whether observations align with known biological mechanisms\n- Pay attention to tissue/cell type specificity\n\n3. Annotation Standards:\n- Use the most specific terms supported by the evidence\n- Include experimental context in annotation extensions when relevant\n- Apply appropriate evidence codes based on methodology\n- Maintain consistent identifier usage\n\nWhen uncertain, use more general terms or withhold annotation until better evidence is available.",
