# Contributing Guidelines

**First off, thank you for considering contributing to our project!** 

These are some of the many ways to contribute:

* Submitting bug reports and feature requests
* Fixing typos and improving the documentation
* Writing code for everyone to use


## Reporting bugs

You can report a bug here: https://github.com/RNAcentral/GO_Flow_LLM/issues. If you find something wrong, or have some weird edge case that causes you a problem, please do report it! Even better, if you can figure out how to fix it!

Use the issues system to submit feature requests as well, but bear in mind this tool is developed by a small team and we might take a while to get to feature requests


## Documentation

The documentation for GOFlowLLM is largely the README in this repo, and the paper. It may be the case that people want to use this tool more broadly, in which case having some better documentation would be excellent. If you manage to get things working for your use case, it would be very helpful to have that documented so others can follow in your footsteps!

## Code contributions

We would welcome any code contributions that improve the reliability of the system, or add extra functionality. We haven't got any CI/CD in place yet, so any code contributions will have to be carefully manually reviewed and tested. But if you have something to contribute, please do!

The way we would expect this to happen would be via a pull request from a fork you make. Base your PR on the main branch of this repo.
